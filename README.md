# Intro-to-Polars-library
# Polars Study Notebook

This repository contains my exploratory work with the **[Polars](https://pola.rs/)** Python library for fast and efficient data manipulation.  
I used a Google Colab notebook to practice querying, transforming, and analyzing tabular data using Polars.

## Motivation
I created this notebook as part of my learning journey to strengthen my skills in modern data manipulation tools beyond pandas.  
This work was inspired by the **[DataCamp Polars Course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-polars)**, which provided a structured introduction to the library.

## Dataset
For practical examples, I used the **[Estimation of Obesity Levels Based on Eating Habits and Physical Condition](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/544/estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition)** dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

This dataset is publicly available and widely used for classification and exploratory data analysis.
